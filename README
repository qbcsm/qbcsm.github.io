# Source code for the QBCSM web page

Our web is **very easy** to mantain.
It is created using a [Hugo template](https://gohugo.io/), which allows us to modify the content using simple, human-readable markdown files instead of scary html.
The web is hosted on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/qbcsm/qbcsm.github.io),
and it is deployed automatically through GitHub Actions without having to do anything.

You can also test the web locally by running the command `hugo server` and opening the link from the terminal.


## Adding content

The templates for new content can be found in the `templates/` directory.
The content that we should update regularly is located in the `content/` directory.
The subfolders that we should modify are:
- `authors/`. Here we add new people to the group. The template file should be renamed to `_index.md`.
- `events/`. New events, conferences, outreach workshops, etc. The template file should be renamed to `index.md`.
- `publications/`. Links to our new papers & preprints. The template file should be renamed to `index.md`.

These folders contain several subfolders, each of which corresponds to a specific page.
For example, the folder called 'events' has a subfolder called '2024-09-setn' with an 'index.md' and an image called 'featured.jpg'.
You can add new events by creating a new folder with a renamed template file.
You could just copy and edit a previous folder, but that might be messy.
The same goes for the other folders.

You can add new images in [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) with whatever name you want, but the main picture for all posts, events and publications must be named `featured.jpg` (or png, whatever).
The only exception to this are profile pictures in the 'authors' subfolders, which are named `avatar.jpg`.
And just in case we can't find a pic for our new beloved comrade, I left an empty 'avatar.jpg' in the templates folder.

To keep things simple, it's best to name these subfolders using the date and name, like `YYYY-MM-name`, so we can keep the house tidy.
The 'authors' subfolders are different, and these should be our own names in lowercase.
This is useful because now we only have to write our names as the authors of new publications, and everything will be linked automatically.

New posts can be programmed for later by setting future dates in the `date` field.
The same can be achieved for publications and events with the `publishDate` field.


## Editing the main menus

The design for the main menus can be modified also from the `content` directory, from `_index.md`, `tour`, `contact`, and `people`.
The shared images for these menus are located in the `assets/media` folder.
