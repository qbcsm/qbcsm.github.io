# Source code for the QBCSM web page

Our web is **very easy** to mantain.
It is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which allows us to modify the content using simple markdown files instead of scary html.
The web is hosted on this GitHub repository, and it is deployed automatically through GitHub Actions without having to do anything.

## Adding content

The content that we should update regularly is located in the `content` directory. The folders that we should modify are:
- `authors`. Here we add new people to the group.
- `event`. New events.
- `publication`. Links to our new publications.
- `post`. Blog posts, latest news, etc. Everyone can share their thoughts here!

These folders contain several subfolders, each of which corresponds to a specific page.
For example, the folder called 'event' has a subfolder called '2024-09-setn' with an 'index.md' and an image called 'featured.jpg'.
You can add new events by copying an old one and changing the content. The same goes for the other folders.

You can add new images in Markdown format with whatever name you want, but the main picture for all posts, events and publications must be named `featured.jpg` (or png, whatever).
The only exception to this are profile pictures in the 'authors' subfolders, which are named `avatar.jpg`.
And just in case we can't find a pic for our new beloved comrade, I left an empty image file called 'avatar_empty.jpg'.

To keep things simple, it's best to name these subfolders using the date and name, like `YYYY-MM-name`, so we can keep the house tidy.
The 'authors' subfolders are different, and these should be our own names.
This is useful because now we only have to write our names as the authors of new publications, and everything will be linked automatically.

New posts can be programmed for later by setting future dates in the `date` field.
The same can be achieved for publications and events with the `publishDate` field.

## Editing the main menus

The design for the main menus can be modified also from the `content` directory, from `_index.md`, `tour`, `contact`, and `people`.
The shared images for these menus are located in the `assets/media` folder.
