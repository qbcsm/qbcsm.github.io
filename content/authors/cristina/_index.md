My work is on the study of cement and construction materials with neutron-based techniques (Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Neutron Diffraction, Neutron Activation Analysis).

Our experiments are performed at big facilities like spallation sources (ISIS, ILL) but also making use of compact neutron sources located in different facilities (ISIS, RIKEN, IAEA) to also explore the capabilities and applications of low-flux neutron sources in the field of construction materials and cultural heritage.
