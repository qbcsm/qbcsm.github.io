R&D Engineer specializing in neutron-based techniques for advanced materials characterization.

My research focuses on neutron activation analysis (NAA) and prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) for studying cement-based materials using Compact Accelerator-based Neutron Sources (CANS). 

Proficient in Monte Carlo simulations of neutron sources for facility optimization, instrument development, and experimental design.
Additionally, I support scientists in complementary techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), providing technical expertise and developing bespoke scientific equipment.
