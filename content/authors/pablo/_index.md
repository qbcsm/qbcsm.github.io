My research centers on the intricate interplay of isotopic effects and stabilization pathways within perovskite materials, a promising class of semiconductors for solar energy conversion.
I delve into the fundamental mechanisms driving these phenomena through the powerful lens of neutron scattering and first-principles calculations.

Beyond the capabilities of current neutron instrumentation, I am also actively involved in the design and development of innovative measurement techniques at Compact Accelerator-based Neutron Systems (CANS), which are currently pushing the boundaries of neutron science.

As a passionate advocate for scientific communication, I relish every opportunity to share our discoveries with a broader audience through outreach initiatives.
