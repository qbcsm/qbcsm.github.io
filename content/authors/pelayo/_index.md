Pelayo here! I am a PhD student at the QBCSM group working focused on unraveling the challenging physico-chemical properties of hybrid perovskites.
To that effect, I take advantage of a wide breadth of experimental and computational tools.
In a nutshell: molecular dynamics and density functional theory are employed in tandem with experiments, most notably beam-time at neutron and synchrotron facilities, in pursuit of meaningful answers to the elusive microscopic picture of these energy materials.
