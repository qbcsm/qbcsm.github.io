Postdoctoral researcher focused on understanding phase transformations and energy-storage mechanisms in photoactive molecular media. 

My work combines molecular dynamics simulations, force-field development, and advanced electronic-structure methods (primarily time-independent and time-dependent density functional theory) to elucidate the structural, dynamical, and excited-state properties governing carbon-based molecular switches, with the goal of establishing new design principles for efficient and responsive energy-storage materials.
