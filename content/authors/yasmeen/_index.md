My research focuses on fabricating innovative conducting or thermosensitive polymers and combining them with various materials, such as carbon materials, quantum dots, and devices like sensors and supercapacitors.
Another key aspect of my work involves developing reverse osmosis cellulose membranes for water desalination.
These projects are highly interdisciplinary and relevant to diverse energy-related applications.

In recent years, my research has primarily revolved around:
- Preparing and characterizing polymers, such as polyamides and conducting polymers.
- Applying conducting polymers in biosensors.
- Developing grafted organic cellulose acetate and crosslinked reverse osmosis membranes for water desalination.
- Synthesizing quantum dots, metal oxides, graphene oxide, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) like ZIF-8 for optical and electronic applications.
