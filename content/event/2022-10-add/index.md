The ADD2022 Conference aims to deepen the understanding and to further the training of the various communities working on real-space data analysis for neutron and x-ray diffraction techniques.
Fourier transformation of diffraction data into real-space, traditionally used for the structural determination of liquids and glasses, is now increasingly employed for partially-disordered crystalline powder samples, as well as for single-crystal samples exhibiting some local atomic disorder, and most recently for short-range spin-spin correlations in disordered or frustrated magnetic systems (in the case of neutron diffraction).
