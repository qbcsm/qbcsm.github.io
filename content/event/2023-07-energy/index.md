The purpose of the school is to address how innovation in the energy sector and integration of different technologies can contribute to the challenge of a rapid de-carbonization.

De-carbonization requires a portfolio of options in which renewables will have to provide the lion share but other technologies such as nuclear and carbon capture and storage will be needed.
Any debate on the energy policy requires a basic understanding of the whole energy field.
It is our collective responsibility as physicists to ensure that such a basic understanding permeates the political debate.
