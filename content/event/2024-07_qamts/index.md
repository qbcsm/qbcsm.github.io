The series of Workshops on Quantum Atomic and Molecular Tunneling Systems has always been highly cross-disciplinary.
It encompasses work on tunneling of protons and heavier species in gas and condensed phases, in general, including biological systems, chemical reactions, transport phenomena in solids and liquids and in systems of lower dimensionality.
