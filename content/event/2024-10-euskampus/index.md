The EHU Euskampus Bordeaux Eguna is the annual meeting to share, raise awareness and highlight the projects and collaborations developed within the framework of this strategic alliance between the UPV/EHU, the University of Bordeaux, the DIPC and Tecnalia, which is extended to all its collaborating entities. This 10th edition looked back at the road travelled in research, training, territorial commitment, internationalisation, sharing, among other things, a retrospective of the people and projects that have marked this period, while looking forward by focusing on the programmes and projects underway and their expected evolution.
