Tom guided a group of Erasmus students from the University of the 
Basque Country that visited several CFM laboratories.
In particular, Tom focused on the laboratories where the Flash DSC2+ and Raman are located.
These laboratories were described in the  context of the research carried out by the group.
The Erasmus students were all undergraduates and master's students from a variety of 
disciplines (architecture, engineering, chemistry, psychology, etc.).
