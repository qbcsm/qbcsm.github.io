Irene presented the talk "Energy and how to store it" in the 
Amaraberri primary school, in the framework of Emakumeak Zientzian.
There were almost 150 students from LH5 and LH6.
The event was also recorded for their school television.
The concepts of sensible heat, latent heat and thermochemical energy were explained by letting them 
move their bodies as molecules, to visualize what can happen at the 
molecular scale when materials store energy.
