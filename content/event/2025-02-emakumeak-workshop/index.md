We participated in a workshop dedicated to women over 55,
in the framework of the Emakumeak Zientzian initiative.
We explained the physics behind experiments they
can replicate at home with daily-life materials, i.e. water balloon 
that does not explode when heated to explain the energy storage 
capacity of water.
