The **Donostia is Science** conference was organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of the Basque Country. 
Over the past five decades, the Faculty has been instrumental in advancing scientific research and fostering a culture of innovation in Donostia-San Sebastián 
and the Basque Country. This milestone anniversary presents a unique opportunity to celebrate the Faculty's achievements in partnership with other leading members 
of the city’s scientific community. I was given the opportunity to represent the QBCSM group by presenting our latest results on stilbenes as photoswitches.
