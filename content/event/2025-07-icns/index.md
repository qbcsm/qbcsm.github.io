We attended the International Conference on Neutron Scattering (ICNS) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Pablo presented the latest research on the isotope effects of perovskite materials under high-pressure regimes. We also attended the ICNS satellite meeting, *Advanced Computer Simulation Methods for Neutron Scattering Instruments*, where we presented a poster on our recent assessment of neutron scattering techniques in compact accelerator-based neutron sources (CANS).
