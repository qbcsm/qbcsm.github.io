Sara and Tom participated in the DIPC’s and CFM’s School Visits Program.
Visits were offered in face-to-face, allowing the students to directly interact with researchers in each session.

The visits included a brief introduction to materials science, nanoscience and research environment,
followed by in-situ visits to the supercomputation facilities at DIPC and the labs at CFM.
