Tom, Sara and Pablo participated in the Science week fair, aimed to all publics.
Tom and Sara demonstrated natural phenomena using simple tools and common items, such as non-newtonian liquids using cornstarch suspensions.
Pablo participated in the "Escala tu mundo" (scale your world) workshop, where kids familiarised with the use of microscopes to understand their world.
