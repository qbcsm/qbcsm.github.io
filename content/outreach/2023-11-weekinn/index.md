Outreach presentation at the WeekINN 2023, on "Materiales de 
almacenamiento de energía: investigación de vanguardia para abordar la 
demanda energética de la vida diaria" (Energy storage materials: cutting-edge research to address the energy demands of everyday life).
The boosting global energy demand and the climatic problems related to fossil fuels consumption 
claim both for new energy storage tools, which are aimed to improve 
energy harvesting from renewable resources and to lighten the 
environmental impact. Aiming to solve these urgent issues, which deal 
and affect everyone's life, cutting-edge research is devoted to the 
investigation of several types of new energy storage materials.
