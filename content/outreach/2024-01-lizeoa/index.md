Together with other CFM and DIPC scientists, Irene did an outreach 
activity consisting in a workshop on materials delivered to high 
school students (Santo Tomas Lizeoa, San Sebastian) in the framework 
of the Innovation Week. The workshop consisted in both frontal lecture 
and practical experiments lasting almost 2 hours. Irene talked about the 
energy storage issue and mentioned our investigation group's studies 
(i.e. phase change materials, photoswitches), as well as computational 
and experimental methodologies we use. Students were particularly 
attracted by the materials properties and interacted with answers and 
questions, especially on the computing part.
