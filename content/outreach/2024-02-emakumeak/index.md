Cristina participated in the workshop ["The power of experience"](https://emakumeakzientzian.eus/es/ekitaldiak/esperientziaren-boterea-cfm/),
which was dedicated to women over the age of 55 and took place as part of the Emakumeak Zientzian initiative.
The participants visited the CFM research center.
They had the opportunity to learn about the ins and outs of the world of research,
immersing themselves in the atmosphere of excellence and internationalism that characterizes our center.
They were also shown experiments that they can replicate at home using everyday materials.
