This activity was organized by the Materials Physics Center's outreach department for high school students from Tolosa.
Led by Pelayo and other researchers from the center,
the students were able to explore a range of scientific instruments ranging from supercomputers to synthesis labs and microscopes that can visualize atoms.
This experience served as a strong incentive for them to continue their studies in the scientific field.
