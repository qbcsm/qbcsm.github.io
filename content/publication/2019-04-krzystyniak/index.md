abstract: "This work introduces the use of mass-selective neutron spectroscopy as an analytical tool for the quantitative and non-destructive detection of hydrogen in bulk media. To this end, systematic measurements have been performed on a series of polyethylene standards of known thickness and density, in order to establish optimal data-acquisition protocols as well as associated limits of detection and quantitation. From this analysis, we conclude that state-of-the-art epithermal-neutron instrumentation enables the detection of aeral molar densities of bulk hydrogen in the μmol cm−2 range. We also discuss potential improvements on the horizon, with a view to broadening the scope of the technique across chemistry, materials science, and engineering."                          #* Copy of the abstract
