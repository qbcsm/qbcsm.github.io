abstract: "Diethylammonium nitrate, [N0 0 2 2][NO3], and its perdeuterated analogue, [ND D 2 2] [NO3], were structurally characterized and studied by infrared, Raman, and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy. Using these experimental data along with state-of-the-art computational materials modeling, we report unambiguous spectroscopic signatures of hydrogen-bonding interactions between the two counterions. An exhaustive assignment of the spectral features observed with each technique has been provided, and a number of distinct modes related to NH···O dynamics have been identified. We put a particular emphasis on a detailed interpretation of the high-resolution, broadband INS experiments. In particular, the INS data highlight the importance of conformational degrees of freedom within the alkyl chains, a ubiquitous feature of ionic liquid (IL) systems. These findings also enable an in-depth physicochemical understanding of protonic IL systems, a first and necessary step to the tailoring of hydrogen-bonding networks in this important class of materials."                          #* Copy of the abstract
