abstract: This work introduces a new sample-preparation methodology to investigate volatile materials with fast scanning calorimetry (FSC). The protocol consists of a two-step process involving the embedding of the specimen in an inert silicone-oil-based matrix followed by gold sputtering, in order to ensure full encapsulation and isolation from the surrounding environment. This novel approach is tested thoroughly on a series of three carbon-based materials â€“ resorcinol, corannulene and perylene. In addition to establishing the validity of our methodology, the FSC data also gives access to new and hitherto unexplored regimes of thermodynamic stability and metastability in these materials, including the emergence of glassy states, cold crystallization, and solid-to-solid transformations.
