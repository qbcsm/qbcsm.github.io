abstract: "In December 1997 the Osiris beamline at the ISIS facility, UK, recorded its first neutron spectrum. The instrument enjoyed a first stint as a cold neutron diﬀractometer before the spectroscopic capabilities were fully commissioned. Osiris soon became a workhorse quasielastic spectrometer as well as a highly successful low-energy spectrometer. The status of the instrument is recognized by the user community with high-impact publications ranging from energy materials over life science to quantum matter. To enhance the existing capabilities a silicon analyzer is under construction. The primary spectrometer will be upgraded with a new supermirror guide providing a factor 10 to 14 increased flux in combination with a new hydrogen moderator. Beyond these developments further improvements of the energy resolution with a combination of a fast pulse shaping chopper and using a direct backscattering geometry are being investigated."                          #* Copy of the abstract
