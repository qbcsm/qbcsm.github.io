abstract: "This work provides a current, critical view of the application of MAss-selective Neutron SpEctroscopy (MANSE) to nanocomposite materials. MANSE is a unique technique made possible owing to the existence of the pulsed neutron sources. At present, the only operating MANSE spectrometer in the world, VESUVIO, is located at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source in the UK. We start by providing a brief description of the neutron Compton scattering, the anatomy of a mass-selective neutron spectrometer, and the experimental data treatment. We continue by briefly outlining the main quantum mechanical concepts, models and approximations relevant both to the ab initio prediction and experimental measurement of main MANSE observables. Next, we present several recent exemplars chosen to highlight the use of MANSE in the field of nanocomposites. Our examples include, in chronological order, encapsulated nanoparticles in amorphous silica gel, bioactive glass-ionomer cement, Cu-Ti-C composites, and sodium carboxymethyl starch-based binders in the presence of a mineral matrix. We close by providing our view of the ongoing and future challenges and opportunities in the mass-selective neutron investigation of NQEs in nanocomposite materials."                          #* Copy of the abstract
