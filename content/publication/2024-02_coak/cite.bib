  abstract = {Rare-earth pyrochlore iridates host two interlocking magnetic sublattices of corner-sharing tetrahedra and can harbour a unique combination of frustrated moments, exotic excitations and highly correlated electrons. They are also the first systems predicted to display both topological Weyl semimetal and axion insulator phases. We have measured the transport and magnetotransport properties of single-crystal Sm2Ir2O7 up to and beyond the pressure-induced quantum critical point for all-in-all-out (AIAO) Ir order at pc\,=\,63\,kbar previously identified by resonant X-ray scattering and close to which Weyl semimetallic behavior has been previously predicted. Our findings overturn the accepted expectation that the suppression of AIAO order should lead to metallic conduction persisting down to zero temperature. Instead, the resistivity-minimum temperature, which tracks the decrease in the AIAO ordering temperature for pressures up to 30 kbar, begins to increase under further application of pressure, pointing to the presence of a second as-yet unidentified mechanism leading to non-metallic behavior. The magnetotransport does track the suppression of Ir magnetism, however, with a strong hysteresis observed only within the AIAO phase boundary, similar to that found for Ho2Ir2O7 and attributed to plastic deformation of Ir domains. Around pc we find the emergence of a new type of electronic phase, characterized by a negative magnetoresistance with small hysteresis at the lowest temperatures, and hysteresis-free positive magnetoresistance above approximately 5\,K. The temperature dependence of our low-temperature transport data are found to be best described by a model consistent with a Weyl semimetal across the entire pressure range.},
