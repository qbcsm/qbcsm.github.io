abstract: Lighting systems with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are an emerging field with high hopes in, for example, neural cell circuits and encoding applications. The major challenges that forfeits their real-world application are i) the design of chiroptical materials (CMs) with high CPL brightness (BCPL; today's record is Eu-based compounds with average 287 M−1cm−1, while 90% of other CMs show <150 M−1cm−1 in solution) and ii) how to keep CPL response in films/coatings of technological relevance. Since natural evolution is driven by chiral selectivity at the supramolecular level, fluorescent proteins (FPs) are ideal candidates to provide large BCPL spanning visible and near-infrared regions. This hypothesis is confirmed for all the known FP classes, demonstrating high emission intensities (photoluminescence quantum yields (ϕ) up to 76%) and record average BCPL of |200| M−1cm−1 (solution). What is more, the CPL response is also kept in polymer coatings. It is rationalized that structural factors (chromophore rigidity, surrounding amino acids, supramolecular packaging, and exciton coupling) hold a significant influence, regardless of the ϕ values. Finally, proof-of-concept CPL-encoded signals in monochromatic/white hybrid light-emitting diodes with FP-polymer filters show exceptional stabilities. Overall, this work stands out FPs toward a new CM family, in general, and biogenic CPL-encoded lighting systems, in particular.
