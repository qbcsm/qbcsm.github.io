    abstract = {In the previous work [Reddy et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 044307 (2019)], we have analyzed the dynamics of the intramolecular singlet fission process in a series of prototypical pentacene-based dimers, where the pentacene monomers are covalently bonded to a phenylene linker in ortho, meta, and para positions. The results obtained were qualitatively consistent with the experimental data available, showing an ultrafast population of the multiexcitonic state that mainly takes place via a mediated (superexchange-like) mechanism involving charge transfer and doubly excited states. Our results also highlighted the instrumental role of molecular vibrations in the process as a sizable population of the multiexcitonic state could only be obtained through vibronic coupling. Here, we extend these studies and investigate the effect of the laser field on the dynamics of intramolecular singlet fission by explicitly including the coupling to the laser field in our model. In this manner, and by selectively tuning the laser field to the different low-lying absorption bands of the systems investigated, we analyze the wavelength dependence of the intramolecular singlet fission process. In addition, we have also analyzed how the nature of the initially photoexcited electronic state (either localized or delocalized) affects its dynamics. Altogether, our results provide new insights into the design of intramolecular singlet fission-active molecules.},
