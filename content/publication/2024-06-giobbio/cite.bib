abstract  ="Heteroleptic silver(i) complexes have recently started to attract attention in thin-film lighting technologies as an alternative to copper(i) analogues due to the lack of flattening distortion upon excitation. However{,} the interpretation of their photophysical behavior is challenging going from traditional fluorescence/phosphorescence to a temperature-dependent dual emission mechanism and ligand-lock assisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Herein{,} we unveil the photoluminescence behavior of a three-coordinated Ag(i) complex with the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand and 2{,}2′-bipyridine (bpy) as the N^N ligand. In contrast to its low-emissive Cu(i) complex structural analogues{,} a strong greenish emission was attributed to the presence of aggregates formed by π–π intermolecular interactions as revealed by the X-ray structure and aggregation induced emission (AIE) studies in solution. In addition{,} the temperature-dependent time-resolved spectroscopic and computational studies demonstrated that the emission mechanism is related to a phosphorescence emission mechanism of two very close lying (ΔE = 0.08 eV) excited triplet states{,} exhibiting a similar delocalized nature over the bipyridine ligands. Unfortunately{,} this favourable AIE is lost upon forming homogeneous thin films suitable for lighting devices. Though the films showed very poor emission{,} the electrochemical stability under device operation conditions is remarkable compared to the prior-art{,} highlighting the potential of [Ag(NHC)(N^N)][X] complexes in thin-film lighting."}
