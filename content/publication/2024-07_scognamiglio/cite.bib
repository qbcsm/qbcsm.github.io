    abstract = {The ultrafast relaxation dynamics of tetracene following UV excitation to the bright singlet state S6 has been studied with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. With the help of high-level ab initio multireference perturbation theory calculations, we assign photoelectron signals to intermediate dark electronic states S3, S4, and S5 as well as to a low-lying electronic state S2. The energetic structure of these dark states has not been determined experimentally previously. The time-dependent photoelectron yields assigned to the states S6, S5, and S4 have been analyzed and reveal the depopulation of S6 within 60 fs, while S5 and S4 are populated with delays of about 50 and 80 fs. The dynamics of the lower-lying states S3 and S2 seem to agree with a delayed population coinciding with the depopulation of the higher-lying states S4–S6 but could not be elucidated in full detail due to the low signal levels of the corresponding two-photon ionization probe processes.},
