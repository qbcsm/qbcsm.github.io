  abstract = {Hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites combine outstanding optoelectronic properties with low-cost fabrication, yet their structural fragility under environmental factors limits device stability. In this work, we have employed high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering in the GPa regime alongside first-principles calculations to probe the pressure-temperature phase behavior of methylammonium lead iodide (\{{\textbackslash}MA\}). Below 1 GPa, we observe a systematic stiffening of NH\${\textbackslash}cdots\$I hydrogen bonds concomitant with a contraction of the inorganic framework. Between 1 and 1.25 GPa, the INS data exhibit a pronounced broadening of cation librational features, corresponding to a transition to highly disordered organic-cation environments reminiscent of (the maximally tilted) high-pressure cubic phase. This hitherto unexplored "derailed" state of \{{\textbackslash}MA\} is characterized by a broad distribution of NH\${\textbackslash}cdots\$I bond lengths, in stark contrast with the well-defined hydrogen-bond network of the low-temperature phase observed at lower pressures. Our experimental and computational results bring to the fore the central (and rather subtle) role played by NH\${\textbackslash}cdots\$I hydrogen bonds across organic and inorganic sub-lattices in dictating the regions of physical stability and metastability of this important material.},
